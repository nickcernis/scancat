# Scan Cat: a website scanning and diagnostic tool

Scan Cat retrieves public information about websites faster than humans can. It's available at https://www.scancat.io.

Scan Cat lets support teams and developers grab facts and guesstimates to help with troubleshooting, returning information such as:

- What version of WordPress is installed?
- Which Genesis child theme is active? What version?
- Which version of Genesis is installed?
- Is the site behind a maintenance mode page?
- Has the site experienced a silent fatal error? (Finds missing `</html>` tags).
- Which popular plugins seem active?
- Is Yoast SEO in use?
- Are common caching plugins active?
- Which host do A records currently point to?
- Is Cloudflare in use?
- Are mail records set up for the domain?

## Features
You can pass a URL to Scan Cat with the url param:
https://www.scancat.io/?url=example.com

## Limitations
Scan Cat is currently optimised for WordPress sites and StudioPress themes and plugins. Other platform and theme support is planned.
